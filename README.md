This game was my first ever entry to Ludum Dare. Also, it's basically a test if ACE is good enough for rapid game development. As it turns out, it's not that polished ATM. ;)

## System requirements

This game is made for Amiga hardware. It should run on any Amiga just fine. Running from HDD is recommended.

Since there was no time for optimizations, code is far from polished. Strong CPU is required - 20MHz or faster. On stock 68000@7MHz you *will* experience flickering.
